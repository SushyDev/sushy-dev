            <p><strong>"You!" a voice boomed.</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>Jake stopped and turned to face a tall, lanky, pale blond man who was obviously angry. <em>"Are you Jake? The new guy?"</em></p>
            <br />
            <p>"Yes," he answered carefully.</p>
            <br />
            <p>"I'm Tom. You broke JDSL!"</p>
            <br />
            <p>"Uh, what?" Jake had only been looking at the customer portal. How could he have caused any problems?</p>
            <br />
            <p>"You broke JDSL!" he screamed. "I'm reporting you to the bosses and having you fired!" And Tom turned and stormed off, leaving Jake standing confused.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Shortly afterwards, Jake was summoned to a small conference room. Tom, an employee from HR, and a couple Vice Presidents waited for him. Tom looked like he was stewing and could boil over any minute.</p>
            <br />
            <p><em>"Tell us what you did to JDSL,"</em> one of the VP's asked.</p>
            <br />
            <p>"I don't think I did anything," Jake answered. "I've only been here two weeks, trying to learn JDSL and how the customer portal works. I don't even know how to deploy it!"</p>
            <br />
            <p>"You made a few commits to Subversion!" Tom shouted.</p>
            <br />
            <p>"Well, yes. I added a few code comments, trying to–"</p>
            <br />
            <p>"You can't use comments in JDSL!" Tom shouted. <strong>"THAT'S WHAT BROKE IT!!"</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>Jake stayed silent, trying to process how code comments could wipe out a customer database. Tom continued after a pause. "I haven't added comment support to JDSL, so the runtime executes comments like normal code! You must have had database updates in some comments?!"</p>
            <br />
            <p>"Well, yeah, I put a couple short syntax examples in a comment to clarify–"</p>
            <br />
            <p>Tom burst to his feet. "I knew it! You <strong>BROKE IT!</strong>" He turned to face the VPs. "I can't deal with coders who don't understand the system! You will either fire Jake... or I quit!" And he stormed out of the room.</p>
